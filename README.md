# Joe's Next.js Template/Boilerplate

I often end up using the same Next.js base in my projects, so I've decided to
create a boilerplate to save time on the initial setup.

This boilerplate is a simple extension of the default `create-next-app` template
with TypeScript and SCSS support added. It also adds some other stuff such as
ESLint and a more refined directory/file structure.

```sh
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/jozsefsallai/next-template
```
